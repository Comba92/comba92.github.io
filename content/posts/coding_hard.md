Today I stumbled upon this video. 
{{< youtube hp4Nlf8IRgs >}}


Now, while watching it, I found it fascintaing, but for different reasons of those you might expect.
I was not fascinated by the optimizations the video presented. I did know about all of them.
The author gives the impression of a beginner programmer, or probably just a little unexperienced (he points out he is a Python programmer, after all, hehe).
However, he is very eager to learn and wants understand what is happening under the hood, so I admire him for this. 
What is *incredibly fascinating* about this video is, that you get to see how an unexperienced person tackles the optimization process of their project, starting from blissful ignorance to a growingly deeper undestanding of the inner workings of the cryptic and alinen technology of computers.

So, I first of all thank the author of the video for sharing his experience without any fear being judged for showing his errors and mistakes. He does quite a few during his ramblings and brainstorming, trying to get his project faster. There are times where he makes something better, but introduces more problems. Though, he continuosly learns new concepts in the process. In the end, he ends up fixing almost all of his omissions!

It is rare to see such a positive and craved for knowledge spirit. I am pretty sure, most people starting out would have felt underwhelmed and frustrated, and would not have investigated further.
This video lead me to think.

*HAVE WE MADE PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE TOO FREAKING HARD?*

Just think about it: you have just started programming. You end up coding a big project, just like the guy in the video did. The project ends up beign incredibly slow and unoptimized. How many people would have dug deeper, trying to improve it and learn all that domain specific knowledge? Trust me, not too many.
This is basically what is happening right now, in the software development world. Think about web developers, or even worse, AI bros. A lot of frivolous, aloof and detached people, who enters the IT world out of greed and nonchalance, instead of passion and joyful interest.

We need more people with this enthusiasm and intelligence. The video's author got from me a like, a subscription and some free advertisement on my blog.

Now, the optimizations he covers aren't all that difficult, but they made me want to write a blog into it, going into more detail about them, and giving more awarness to the average programmer.

# The optimizations
## Data construction and scopes
## Collections, allocation, and asymptotic complexity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VHG6Y2QmtM
## Always do less work
## Duplication, copy-pasting, refactoring and abstracting
## Static, const, and dynamic data
## Passing by value/copy and by reference
## Data compression
## Multithreading and data sharing
## Printing, systemcalls, and the cost of abstractions
## Batching I/O and networking
